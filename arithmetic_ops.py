# Basic arithmetic operations in python

a = 10
b = 4

# Addition
print(f"This will give the addition of {a} and {b} = {a + b}")

# Subtraction
print(f"This will give the subtraction of {a} and {b} = {a - b}")

# Multiplication
print(f"This will give the multiplication of {a} and {b} = {a * b}")

# Division
print(f"This will give the division of {a} by {b} = {a / b}")

# Modulus
print(f"This will return the reminder of {a} divided by {b} = {a % b}")

# Division floor
print(f"This will give the whole number when dividing {a} and {b} = {a // b}")

# Exponent / power
print(f"This will give {a} power {b} = {a ** b}")
